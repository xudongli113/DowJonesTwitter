<h2>Getting started with EC2</h2>

<div class="post">
<div class="content">

<p>This tutorial will get you started with
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> on Amazon's EC2 (running the simple
word count demo).  For a gentler introduction to Hadoop, or if you
don't feel like experimenting with EC2, try my tutorial
on <a href="start-standalone.html">getting started in standalone mode</a>.  This
tutorial assumes you've already downloaded
the libraries and gotten it set up.</p>

<p>Before we begin, a few notes:</p>

<ul>

  <li>For writing these instructions I used Hadoop 0.20.1 (stock
  distribution available from Apache) and Sun's Java JDK 1.6.0_06 on
  Windows XP (with Cygwin).  However, these instructions should be
  applicable to other operating systems.  In fact, the Hadoop EC2
  scripts are not very Windows-friendly at all (I'll describe several
  workarounds below).</li>

  <li><b>For Windows users:</b> If you are using Windows, you must
  use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>, as the EC2 tools
  will not work with the Windows command prompt.  You will also need
  ssh, which is not installed as part of Cygwin by default.  Once
  you've installed Cygwin, run the setup program and specifically
  install it.</li>

  <li>Note that I'm showing commands as they apply to me: you'll have
  to change paths, name of machines, etc. as appropriate.</li>

  <li>In capturing traces of commands running, I use the convention of
  [...] to indicate places where the output has been truncated.</li>

  <li>You'll be typing a lot of commands on the command-line.  What
  I've found helpful is to keep a text file open to keep track of the
  commands I've entered.  This is useful for both fixing inevitable
  typos in command-line arguments and for retracing your steps
  later.</li>

  <li>It is best to allocate an uninterrupted block of time to this
  tutorial, because once you start up an EC2 cluster, you're being
  charged by time.</li>

  <li>There's a section at the end of this tutorial on common
  issues.</li>

</ul>

<p>Just to give you an overview, here are the steps:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="#step1">Step 1:</a> Setting up Amazon EC2</li>
  <li><a href="#step2">Step 2:</a> Fire up a Hadoop cluster in the clouds!</li>
  <li><a href="#step3">Step 3:</a> Test drive the cluster</li>
  <li><a href="#step4">Step 4:</a> Transfer some data</li>
  <li><a href="#step5">Step 5:</a> Transfer some code and run the word count demo</li>
  <li><a href="#step6">Step 6:</a> Clean up!</li>
  <li><a href="#ps">Postscript</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Let's get started!</p>

<div class="post">
<h2><a style="text-decoration:none; color:#555;" id="step1">Step 1: Setting up Amazon EC2</a></h2>
<div class="content">

<p>Go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon AWS site</a> to
set up an AWS account.  Follow the steps
at <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2007-01-03/">Amazon's
EC2 Getting Started Guide</a>, up through the "Generating a Keypair"
section of the "Running an Instance" page (page 5).  The current
version of the EC2 API tools is 1.3-46266.</p>

<p><b>Helpful tip:</b> when you generate an access key, try to avoid
one that has a slash (/) in it&mdash;this will save you some effort
later, because some tools cannot properly parse the slash and treats
it as a path.  If you get an access key that has a slash, just
regenerate.</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">
<h2><a style="text-decoration:none; color:#555;" id="step2">Step 2: Fire up a Hadoop cluster in the clouds!</a></h2>
<div class="content">

<p>You'll want to
consult <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/AmazonEC2">Running
Hadoop on Amazon EC2</a> for reference, but I'll summarize the
instructions below.  To begin, make sure you're working with Hadoop
0.20.1 (stock Apache distribution) and have the EC2 environment
variables properly set (see previous step).  Note that all the Amazon
tools begin with "ec2-", which distinguishes them from tools bundle in
the Hadoop distribution.</p>

<p>In case you are curious, here's how you find all available Hadoop
images with the Amazon EC2 tool.</p>

<pre>
$ ec2-describe-images -x all | grep hadoop
</pre>

<p>You'll be surprised at how many Hadoop AMIs there are!</p>

<p>Open the file
hadoop-0.20.1/src/contrib/ec2/bin/hadoop-ec2-env.sh.
Fill in the following variables with information from you own
account:</p>

<ul>

  <li>AWS_ACCOUNT_ID (no dashes)</li>
  <li>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</li>
  <li>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're using Cygwin, you may also want to tweak the following
variables:</p>

<ul>

  <li>MASTER_PRIVATE_IP_PATH</li>
  <li>MASTER_IP_PATH</li>
  <li>MASTER_ZONE_PATH</li>

</ul>

<p>These files store information about the cluster you've started up.
The variables have paths containing ~, which in Windows will map to
something like "C:\Documents and Settings\...".  That's a path
containing spaces, which breaks some of the Hadoop EC2 scripts.</p>

<p><b>For Cygwin users only:</b> As previously mentioned, the Hadoop
EC2 scripts are not very Windows-friendly.  If you don't implement the
below workaround, you'll get the following error.</p>

<pre>
Invalid argument for option '-f, --user-data-file DATA-FILE': '/cygdrive/c/...' (-h for usage)
</pre>

<p>The issue is that USER_DATA_FILE, defined in hadoop-ec2-env.sh,
needs to be passed in as a parameter to the EC2 startup scripts.
Something strange about Cygwin screws that up.  To fix the problem,
you'll need to go into hadoop-0.20.1/src/contrib/ec2/bin.  On line 88
of launch-hadoop-master, you'll see this following line:</p>

<pre>
INSTANCE=`ec2-run-instances ... -f "$bin"/$USER_DATA_FILE ...
</pre>

<p>Remove the "$bin" so that it reads:</p>

<pre>
INSTANCE=`ec2-run-instances ... -f $USER_DATA_FILE ...
</pre>

<p>On line 53, of launch-hadoop-slaves, you'll see this following line:</p>

<pre>
ec2-run-instances ... -f "$bin"/$USER_DATA_FILE.slave ...
</pre>

<p>Remove the "$bin" so that it reads:</p>

<pre>
ec2-run-instances ... -f $USER_DATA_FILE.slave ...
</pre>

<p><b>&lt;end Cygwin workaround&gt;</b></p>

<p>Open a shell and go to hadoop-0.20.1/src/contrib/ec2/bin.  Launch a EC2
cluster and start Hadoop with the following command. You must supply a
cluster name (test-cluster) and the number of slaves (2 in my
case). At this point, it makes no sense to start up a large cluster
(even if you can!)&mdash;one or two nodes is sufficient.  After the
cluster boots, the public DNS name will be printed to the console.</p>


<pre>
$ ./hadoop-ec2 launch-cluster test-cluster 2
Testing for existing master in group: test-cluster

i-ec191684
i-ee191686
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> In Cygwin, the script may complain about not being
able to find the dig DNS utility (as with above).  There doesn't
appear to be a standard Cygwin package that contains the utility, but
not having it is okay (you'll notice that the actual IP address for
the cluster is missing).  Don't worry about it.</p>

<p>The meter has just started running... so you're being billed for
usage starting now.  After a little bit, you should be able to access
the jobtracker webapp on port 50030 of the master, which in my case
is:</p>

<pre>
http://ec2-75-101-178-200.compute-1.amazonaws.com:50030/
</pre>

<p>Obviously, your master will have a different public address.  Now
navigate to that URL in a browser, and you should see something
like <a href="start-ec2-cropped.png">this screenshot of the jobtracker
webapp</a>.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you've just started a Hadoop cluster in the
clouds!  You'll notice that the cluster is actually running Hadoop
0.19.0.  Unfortunately, that's the most recently available AMI (as of
Jan. 2010).  Under "Nodes", you should see 2, since we started up two
slaves.  If the number of nodes is 0, the slaves are probably booting
up... wait a bit and then check again.</p>

<p>You can use the EC2 tools to see the instances you're running:</p>

<pre>
$ ec2-describe-instances
RESERVATION     r-6e5cc706      613871172339    test-cluster-master
INSTANCE        i-961a15fe      ami-fa6a8e93    ec2-75-101-178-200.compute-1.amazonaws.com  [...]

</pre>

<p>Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<h2><a style="text-decoration:none; color:#555;" id="step4">Step 4: Transfer some data</a></h2>
<div class="content">

<p>Now we're getting ready to run the word count demo.  Before doing
that, you have to first transfer some data over to the cloud (those
are the words we're counting).  Make sure you're still logged into the
master.  The following command shows you what's in HDFS.</p>

<pre>
[root@domU-12-31-39-02-61-03 hadoop-0.19.0]# bin/hadoop dfs -ls /
Found 2 items
drwxr-xr-x   - root supergroup          0 2010-01-27 18:56 /mnt
drwxr-xr-x   - root supergroup          0 2010-01-27 19:05 /user
</pre>

<p>Right now, not much, but we're going to put some stuff there.  Open
a shell on your local machine and go to umd-hadoop-core/data.  Now scp the
sample data over to the master.</p>

<pre>
$ scp -i YOUR_PATH/id_rsa-gsg-keypair bible+shakes.nopunc root@ec2-75-101-178-200.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/tmp
</pre>

<p>Of course, substitute YOUR_PATH and the name of your master
accordingly.  As a convention, I like to copy things over to /tmp/ on
the master.  Note that you're being charged for bandwidth usage in
moving data into the clouds.  Another note: you actually only need one
of the files to run the word count demo, but it makes sense just to
copy everything over anyway, in case you want to play with the other
demos.</p>

<p>So now the data is on the local drive of the master.  Next, we have
to put the data into HDFS, i.e., distribute the data across all nodes
in the cluster.  Create the appropriate directories in HDFS:</p>

<pre>
[root@domU-12-31-39-02-61-03 hadoop-0.19.0]# bin/hadoop fs -mkdir /data
</pre>

<p>The dump the data into HDFS:</p>

<pre>
[root@domU-12-31-39-02-61-03 hadoop-0.19.0]# bin/hadoop fs -put /tmp/bible+shakes.nopunc /data
</pre>

<p>Now you should be able to see the data in HDFS.</p>

<pre>
[root@domU-12-31-39-02-61-03 hadoop-0.19.0]# bin/hadoop fs -ls /data
Found 1 items
-rw-r--r--   3 root supergroup    9068074 2010-01-27 19:12 /data/bible+shakes.nopunc
</pre>

<p>Data's there... now for the code.</p>

</div></div>


<div class="post">

</pre>

<p>If there's nothing in build/, go back in Eclipse and make sure the

<p>Congratulations!  You have now learned the basics of Hadoop on EC2.
Step 1 starts your cluster in the clouds, so you have to do it before
you start working every time.  Step 4 is required every time you want
to process a new dataset&mdash;you have to copy it into the clouds.
Step 5 represents your typical debug cycle: write code, pack it up,
scp it over to the cluster, and submit the job.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, how do you see the actual output of the
program?  Word counts are stored in a directory in HDFS specified in
the MapReduce program.  You can see those files by issuing the
following command:</p>

<pre>
[root@domU-12-31-39-02-61-03 hadoop-0.19.0]# bin/hadoop fs -ls /wc
Found 2 items
drwxr-xr-x   - root supergroup          0 2010-01-27 19:16 /wc/_logs
-rw-r--r--   3 root supergroup     447180 2010-01-27 19:17 /wc/part-00000
</pre>

<p>A file gets created for each reducer, and the final key-value pairs
get written there.  Since this demo specifies only one reducer, we
have only one file.  You can fetch this file from HDFS and then do
whatever you want with it (examine the output, scp back to your local
machine, etc.):</p>

<pre>
[root@domU-12-31-39-02-61-03 hadoop-0.19.0]# bin/hadoop fs -get /wc/part-00000 .

<p>For more on working with HDFS, see <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/hdfs_shell.html">this
guide to HDFS shell commands</a>.</p>

<p>And that's it!  If you're feeling up to it, you might want to
continue on directly to my next tutorial, <a
href="start-S3.html">getting started with S3</a>.  Otherwise, remember
the most important thing of all... continute to step 6.</p>

<p>So what's the "elastic" part of the cloud?  If you need more
processing power, you can grow your cluster dynamically with the
following command (which will add five instances to your cluster):</p>

<pre>
$ bin/hadoop-ec2 launch-slaves test-cluster 5
</pre>

<p>In fact, you can issue the command as many times as you want to
grow your cluster!  In theory, HDFS should kick in a rebalance all
your data blocks, ensure proper replication, etc.  However, if your
HDFS data is stored in S3, I've found it easiest to simply remove all
files from HDFS and recopy over from S3 (in essence, forcing proper
redistribution of the blocks).</p>

<h2><a style="text-decoration:none; color:#555;" id="step6">Step 6: Clean up!</a></h2>
<div class="content">

<p>You'll want to clean up after you're done.  Remember, the meter
doesn't stop (i.e., the bill continues to accumulate, dime by dime)
until you shut down your Hadoop cluster.  To do so, open a shell on
your local machine and go to
hadoop-0.20.1/src/contrib/ec2/bin:</p>

<pre>
$ ./hadoop-ec2 terminate-cluster test-cluster
Running Hadoop instances:
INSTANCE        i-961a15fe      ami-fa6a8e93 [...]
INSTANCE        i-ec191684      ami-fa6a8e93 [...]
INSTANCE        i-ee191686      ami-fa6a8e93 [...]
Terminate all instances? [yes or no]: yes
INSTANCE        i-ec191684      running shutting-down
INSTANCE        i-961a15fe      running shutting-down
INSTANCE        i-ee191686      running shutting-down
</pre>

<p>Confirm that the instances have indeed gone away:</p>

<pre>
$ ec2-describe-instances
RESERVATION     r-6e5cc706      613871172339    test-cluster-master
INSTANCE        i-961a15fe      ami-fa6a8e93                    terminated [...]
RESERVATION     r-ee5cc786      613871172339    test-cluster
INSTANCE        i-ec191684      ami-fa6a8e93                    terminated [...]
INSTANCE        i-ee191686      ami-fa6a8e93                    terminated [...]
</pre>

<p>And this concludes your first adventure in the clouds!</p>

<p>Log into <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">your AWS account</a> and
check your bill: right side of your screen, "Your Account" drop-down
menu, "Account Activity".  How much cash did you burn?  Now, is
utility computing fun or what?</p>

<div class="post">
<h2>Common Issues</h2>
<div class="content">

<p><b>In Windows, avoid paths with ~ and paths with space</b></p>

<p>Paths with spaces break the EC2 scripts.  Avoid using ~ in paths
also since it (depending on setup) maps to C:\Document and
Settings\..., which has spaces in it.</p>

<p><b>EC2 Authentication errors</b></p>

<p>If you're getting an error such as the following:</p>

<pre>
Client.AuthFailure: AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials
</pre>

<p>Check to see if you've actually signed up for your EC2 account.
Note that once you've signed up for your AWS account, you still must
sign up for EC2.</p>
